      <p>“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.”<b> Philippians 1:21 </b><br><br>

        These are the words of Apostle Paul in his letter to the Philippians. 
After being healed from depression and suicidal thoughts, and after genuinely encountering God and the gospel, 
my stance on life and death are as follows:<br><br><br>


There is a quote, “All death can do to a believer is to bring him to Jesus”.
And this is also the reason why Paul says, “to die is gain”. <br><br><br>

Then why do we continue to live? Because there is still work to be done. 
The gospel is so transformative because it opens my eyes to a higher calling, a deeper purpose.<br><br><br>

The world still lacks love; many still search for the way, the truth, and the life. And I believe that as long as I am alive, God wants to use me in some kind of way on this earth -- and I won’t run away from it.<br><br><br>
