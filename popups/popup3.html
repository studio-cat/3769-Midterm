      <p>“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
        Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
        and you will find rest for your souls. 
        For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” <b>Matthew 11:28-30</b><br><br>


        The Christian life is not easy. Jesus calls his followers to “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.” (Matthew 7:13-14) How can the “narrow path” be the “easy yoke” at the same time?<br><br><br>


        It is the easiest thing for me to chase after the prizes of the world. Every day, I am tempted by what I see: the newest technology, the internship from the dream company, prestigious fellowships, ... <br><br><br>
        
        Similar things I pursued during my high school years, all for the sake of “getting into college”. <br><br><br>
        
        Praises of the world are like sugar. It feeds directly into the bloodstream giving you a “high,” only to crash afterwards and fuel a desire for more. For me, all the things I did to “look good” only fed directly into my pride, and this pride came right back biting at me. <br><br><br>
