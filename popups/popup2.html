      <p>“For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him to the glory forever. Amen” <b> Romans 11:36</b><br><br>

        <b>“Steward”, not “Standard”.</b> <br><br>


My name is “다예", which means “many arts & talents”.
I grew up hearing that I was “good at everything”, “perfect”, etc.
which only fed into my pride and a chasing after the praises of the world.

While in the moment, it was sweet as honey, everything eventually came back to bite me, eating away at my heart. <br><br><br>


One night, I had a revelation: that all the talents, skills, I had -- and dearly held onto and relied upon to build my sense of self-worth -- was not mine to begin with. God could take away any of said “skill” or “talent” at any minute. I was grabbing so hard to things that weren’t mine.<br><br><br>

Then, everything ought to return to its rightful owner.
Everything I do, ought to reflect glory back to God. 
That was the original, intended purpose. <br><br><br>

Whether it is celebrating the beauty of his creations, testifying of his goodness, or speaking the truth--
It is truly such a fulfilling thing. 
The true purpose has been found.<br><br><br>
While I still do value hard work and excellence, there is no true need to measure up to any standard.
