      <p>"You knitted me together in my mother’s womb.
        I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”<b> Psalms 139:13-14</b>

      <p>May 23, 2024 in the middle of a rural desert town of San Telmo, Mexico <br><br>
        -- a place that doesn’t even show up on Google Maps -- <br><br>
        God met me. <br><br><br>

        I remember asking God, out of frustration and confusion, <br><br>
        “Why do you say you love me, when I am a sinner, nothing of worth?”<br><br><br>

        
        and He gave me an image of a figure--who I knew to be my mom--holding a baby (me) ; then the words, “for you are fearfully and wonderfully made”<br><br><br>

        
        It completely redirected my perception of the source of my self-worth. <br><br>
        It was not because of anything that I have done, or ever could do.<br><br>
        Rather, to know that my creator has “chosen [me] in Him before the foundation of the world, that [I] should be holy and blameless before him; that in love he pre-destined [me] for adoption to himself as [daughter] through Jesus Christ.” <br><br><br>

        
        If this is indeed the true, divine will, <br><br>

        who am I to deny what my creator Himself has stated?</p>
